# Prediction Game

Who can win the prediction game still?

This has been going for many years, and archived years are here too.

## How It Works

Each contestant ranks 25 predictions from 1 (most likely) to 25 (least likely). Points are awarded based on how high you ranked predictions that come true - the higher the rank, the more points you get.

## Tie-Breaking Rules

When two or more contestants are tied for the highest score, we use a hierarchical tie-breaking system:

1. **Start with the highest-ranked prediction (25 points)**: Compare who got their 25-point prediction correct
2. **Move down the rankings**: If still tied, compare 24-point predictions, then 23-point, and so on
3. **First difference wins**: The first person to have a higher-ranked correct prediction wins the tiebreaker
4. **Example**: If Alice got her 25 and 24 correct, but Bob only got his 25 correct, Alice wins the tiebreaker

This ensures that contestants who were more confident about their highest-ranked predictions have an advantage in tie situations.
